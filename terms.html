          </div>
          <p>The information provided on this Site — including articles, condition descriptions, treatment summaries, videos, and FAQs — is intended to support, not replace, the relationship between patients and their healthcare providers. Always seek the advice of a qualified physician or other licensed healthcare professional with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.</p>
          <p>Never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have read on this website. If you think you may have a medical emergency, call 911 or go to your nearest emergency room immediately.</p>
          <p>Capital ENT &amp; Sinus Center does not recommend or endorse any specific treatment, procedure, physician, product, or opinion mentioned on the Site. Reliance on any information provided by Capital ENT, our staff, or other visitors to the Site is solely at your own risk.</p>

          <p>Use of this website, completion of appointment request forms, submission of questions through the "Ask the ENT" feature, or any other interaction with this Site does <strong>not</strong> create a doctor-patient relationship between you and Capital ENT &amp; Sinus Center or any of our physicians.</p>
          <p>A doctor-patient relationship is only established when a physician at Capital ENT has agreed to treat you, you have agreed to be treated, and clinical care has been initiated — typically beginning at your first confirmed in-person or telehealth appointment.</p>
          <p>Communications submitted through this website are not reviewed in real time and should not be used for urgent medical matters. If you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 911. For urgent ENT concerns, contact our office directly at <a href="tel:5123394040">512-339-4040</a>.</p>
